# 🦋 Butterflies

🦋 🦅 🦏 🦎

This is a python library written in rust that implements relatively efficient searches for `call butterflies` and `call condors`. 

Eventually this repo will probably change names to be inclusive of more creatures in the market! Maybe we'll see some rhinos and lizards, who knows. Also, this library will eventually support put based strategies and put+call ones too 🧠.

All of this is brought to you with ❤️ by ranger dave.
